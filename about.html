        <p class="about-head">Wood ...</p>
        <p class="about-text">I can remember when I was young watching my father. He had ALL the tools and knew how to use them. He had built a credenza out of mostly cherry. The skin was concentric diamonds made of small planks. Both ends had an arc with a mirror strip facing front. They started at the edge of the top of it, and went down to the base where the wheels would be. There were 3 drawers. There were 3 compartments underneath that had 2 opposing doors each. The diamond pattern would be half on the left door and half on the right door. The way it all fit together and worked was amazing. AMAZING! And the fact that my father could do that was more amazing. He enjoyed working with wood. I do too. I didn't know a lick about it when I was young, but today, that's different.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="about-text">I'm not currently building furniture, certainly nothing as awesome as that. But, I have seen through my fathers' eyes the beauty of wood. I've learned from many other people so much about wood and it's foibles and nuances. I've been carving for a couple years now and it all started rather innocently. My wife had bought a bracelet. It wasn't anything super special, but it meant something. It was a black leather band with a little aluminum disc on it. On the disc was a single image, a <a href="https://studentaffairs.missouri.edu/news/stories-behind-the-semicolon/">semicolon</a>. When she explained it to me I wanted to show my support. So, I carved a semicolon into a wood disc. I punched a hole in it, braided some leather and jute and made a necklace of it. One of our friends said she'd like a bracelet, so I carved her a bracelet charm and braided some leather for her. Then, I kept seeing more and more of my family and friends that could use a little extra support. So, that kinda' blew up.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="about-text">A lady I worked with at one point had given me a lot of wood scraps that her father never used, and since he had passed she wanted to make sure that it was used. She liked what I was doing and so donated it to me. There was a chunk of ebony in there. I'm working on a semi charm for my wife out of half of that chunk. One day, I was just sitting and looking at this other chunk and thought..."I could make a circle out of that. An empty circle. Someone could probably slide it onto a finger or something." And so I started carving. This <a href="/pics/597.jpg">ring</a> is what came of that. And, that's not finished. Since then, I've been finding all kinds of different soft woods and hard woods in all of the different colors. It's truly incredible how much variety there is. I will work with any wood. Since some are more difficult to work with there may be extra fees now and again. But, the beauty that comes from them is worth it. I don't charge astronomical prices because I don't need to.</p>
        </br>
        <p class="about-text">I'm not a real artistic kind of guy. I enjoy working with wood and seeing what I can find in it. If you have an idea as to what you would like, then let me know. I find myself carving and I have a lot of questions as far as what can be done and what should be done. I'm learning about shapes and I'm learning how to use different finishes from stains, wax, urethane, BLO, tung oil, and even resin. So, email me, let's talk. If I can make what you want then I will certainly try to make it right for you. PERFECT for you. Just know, all of my stuff has IMPERFECTIONS in them. That's not a statement about just me, but about mankind in general. Like the semi, it's a reminder. We all need to remember that we are imperfect. All the humans that live outside of our minds are imperfect. Let's be patient and loving so much as we can.</p>

        <p class="about-text">I have a page labeled <a href="/designs.html">Design Options</a> and a page labeled <a href="/ideas.html">Ideas and Suggestions</a>. I will post the different ideas I have there. I'm always up for learning new skills, so if you don't see what you're looking for there, talk to me and let's work together to make it.</p>
