                <p class="news-p">This has been a while in the making. I'm so excited to finally have the site up and working. Mostly. I'm growing in my website coding skill at about the same rate as I grow in my carving skill. It's been a real journey, one that I don't expect to end anytime soon.</p>
            </br>
                <p class="news-p">I'm excited to show some of my pieces. You can read my story on the About page. I will try to keep a journal of pieces I'm working on, shows we plan to go to, etc. My email is on the Contacts page, please email with any ideas or suggestions you may have. If there's something you would like that isn't a ring, please let me know. I would love to work on new and interesting pieces. Thank you for visiting and I hope you'll hang around and enjoy my journey as much as I do!</p>
